    <h3>Description</h3>

        'Mai nama'.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>White pepper and salt</li>
        <li>Chicken boullion/Maggi</li>
        <li>Hot ground pepper</li>
        <li>Sirloin steak</li>
        <li>Meat skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the meat skewers in water for at least 20 minutes to prevent burning</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 F. Lightly oil the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Peel roasted peanuts, and then grind them in a coffee grinder with skin on, until finely crushed, being careful not to grind them into a paste</li>
        <li>Mix garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, white pepper, cayenne pepper, hot ground pepper, and bouillon (or Maggi) in a medium bowl. Add the ground peanuts to the spice mixture. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>Pat the suya steaks dry with a paper towel. You want to have a completely dry steak before cooking. Slice the steak diagonally in medium-thin strips</li>
        <li>Add about 2 tablespoons of oil into the sliced beef, followed by 2-3 tablespoons or half of the suya spice mixture (set aside the rest of the spice rub). Mix everything until fully combined. </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a plastic cling wrap and marinate for an hour</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, thread the beef strips onto the skewers, about four per skewer, making sure the slices of meat cover the skewers.</li>
        <li>Rub the skewered steak strips on both sides with the rest of the spice mixture. Then line a roasting or baking sheet with foil and place the skewers on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with oil and bake them for about 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the last 3 minutes of baking, switch the setting from bake to broil to get a nice crisp brown on the outside.</li>
        <li>Serve fresh from the oven or grill with onions and tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Optional:</strong> You may also grill your suya beef. Brush the grill rack with oil and place the skewered meat on the rack. Brush them with oil and grill for a few minutes or until lightly charred, then turn and grill on the other side â€“
        about 3-5 minutes for each side, depending on the thickness of the meat slices.</p>
